            <p>I recently spent 3 hours with a friend trying to
                answer the following question: “What are three words that describe your personality?” </p>
            <p>Turns out that we didn’t really know each other that
                well, and that three words are far from enough words to describe a person. That being said, I think that
                in any given situation there are a few character traits that are particularly salient.</p>
            <p>Take, for example, getting a meal with an old high
                school friend. After not catching up for years, what do you talk about? Do you just hear life updates?
                Do joke about old memories? Do you try to discover who’ve they become? While these (and more) are all
                reasonable conversation paths, the mentality you bring to the conversation heavily dictates which route
                you walk down. If I was curious and concrete, I’d ask a lot about the specific events that have
                happened. If I was nostalgic and lonely, I’d reminisce about the old times. And if I was feeling
                particularly visionary, I’d definitely try to piece together the human they’ve grown into.</p>
            <p>Now contrast that with the example of debugging some
                React code you wrote a few days ago. If I was impatient and careless, I’d be setting myself up for a
                frustrating few hours. If I was detail-oriented and focused, I’d be in for a slow but satisfying burn.
                And maybe being rationally resourceful and patient would lead to a creative debugging session.</p>
            <p>Finally, a fun example: a date with someone you’ve
                been talking to on Hinge. The possibility space here is huge: you can be ANYONE you want. Pick a few
                adjectives from this list: kind, curious, self-centered, thoughtful, loud, charismatic, shy, sad, and
                greedy. Every set that you choose creates an entirely different experience - some good, some bad, and
                some in between.</p>
            <p>Importantly, the choice of adjectives is neither
                objectively good nor objectively bad - it’s simply good or bad <em>for that situation, </em>which
                creates good or bad experiences.</p>
            <p>I’ve taken this thought exercise and tried to expand
                it into a mindfulness practice. Each time I have a major context switch, I ask myself “what type of
                person do I want to be in this specific situation?” This has been excellent for 1) enabling the context
                switching to be more thorough, and 2) noticing when I feel I’m not acting like the person I want to be.
            </p>
            <p>With regards to 2), doing a quick re-evaluation leads
                to either an attitude or adjective adjustment. In other words, I notice suboptimal behavior (for that
                situation) sooner and either 1) adjust said behavior or 2) adjust what type of person I want to be in
                that situation.</p>
            <p>After actively practicing for a few weeks now, I've found it to be quite useful in my life. There are a few times when I’ve struggled with whatever activity is on
                hand, then realized I was stuck in a different “character”. It’s been rather helpful shifting from
                programming → email writing, working → socializing, working → reading, and even getting in the mood for
                bedtime. Quite a nice sense of intentionality. </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>Disclaimer: This framework is predicated on the axiom
                that humans can shift prioritizing different dimensions without repercussions. This is not an obvious
                belief, as it’s quite easy to lose a “sense of self” when switching “situational character”. I've
                written another whole essay on this topic, <a href="blogs/code_switching.html">Code Switching</a>. </p>
