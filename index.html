<h2>Hi! I'm Andy Zhu.</h2>
<h3>I'm currently at <a href="https://cursor.so">Cursor</a> focused on building out the founding team.</h3>

<h3>I generally enjoy being at the intersection of operational and technical problems, espeically with poorly defined feedback loops. In the past, 
        I cofounded an AI drug discovery company (now defunct), made markets at <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/">Jane Street</a>, and learned a lot about 
        startups at <a href="https://mem.ai/">Mem</a>. I've previously been interested and spent time (hopefully!) getting good at teaching, community building, 
        games, and astrophysics.

    <h3>I graduated from <a href="https://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a>, where I studied math.</h3>
