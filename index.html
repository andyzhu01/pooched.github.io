  <h2>Hi! I'm Andy Zhu.</h2>
  <h3>I'm currently living in SF spending most of my time trying to learn new things.</h3>

<div class="main-content">
  <h3>I generally enjoy being at the intersection of operational and technical problems, especially with poorly defined feedback loops. In the past, I cofounded an AI drug discovery company (now defunct), made markets at <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/">Jane Street</a>, and learned a lot about startups at <a href="https://cursor.so">Cursor</a> and <a href="https://mem.ai/">Mem</a>. I've previously been interested and spent time (hopefully!) getting good at teaching, community building, games, and astrophysics.</h3>
  <h3>I graduated from <a href="https://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a>, where I studied math.</h3>
